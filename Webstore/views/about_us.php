		<h1>About BoardGamer</h1>
		<p>Our website is built and run by board game enthusiasts who wish to introduce the joy of board gaming to anyone interested!
			This business started in 2004 at our local shop at 4 Privet Drive. It expanded to this webstore in 2008 and access to new
			boardgames is now easier than ever! We can deliver them right to your front door.
			
			If you want to get involved with our great community of board-gamers and introduce yourself to new boardgames as well, game nights are hosted at our shop every
			wednesday and saturday at 7PM. Everyone is welcome!
